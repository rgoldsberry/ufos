Data Analysis Bootcamp - Week 11

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to create a web page that displays a dynamic table, created with javascript then displayed via html, of UFO sightings, catalogued in [data.js](static/js/data.js). For the module lesson we created a simple filter that allowed the user to filter the sightings by date. For the challenge afterwards we were asked to add additional filters for city, state, country, and shape that can be used in combination with each other.

## Data Sources

- [data.js](static/js/data.js)

## Results

Describe how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary

In a summary statement, describe one drawback of the new design created for the challenge and two recommendations for further development.
